        <p class="font1">Shivneri Fort is a 17th-century military fortification located near Junnar in Pune district in
            Maharashtra, India. It is the birthplace of Shivaji, the emperor and founder of Maratha Empire. </p>

        <p class="font1"> <br> History :- <br>

            Shivneri is known to be a place of Buddhist dominion from the 1st century AD. Its caves, rock-cut
            architecture and water system indicate the presence of habitation since 1st century AD. Shivneri got its
            name as it was under the possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. This fort was mainly used to guard the old
            trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. The place passed on to the Bahmani Sultanate after the
            weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century and it then passed on to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in
            the 16th century. In 1595, a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhonsle, the grandfather of Shivaji Bhosale, was
            enabled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan. Shivaji was born
            at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood there. Inside the
            fort is a small temple dedicated to the goddess Shivai Devi, after whom Shivaji was named. The English
            traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible. According to his accounts, the fort was
            well-stocked to feed thousand families for seven years. The fort came under the control of the British Rule
            in 1820 after the Third Anglo-Maratha War.[citation needed]

            In 2021, it was added to the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage sites as part of "Serial Nomination
            of Maratha Military Architecture in Maharashtra"</p>

        <p class="font1"> <br> Architecture  :- <br>
            Shivneri Fort[3] is a hill fort having a triangular shape and has its entrance from the South-west side of
            the hill.[4] Apart from the main gate there is an entrance to the fort from side called locally as the chain
            gate, where in one has to hold chains to climb up to the fort gate. The fort extends up to 1 mi (1.6 km)
            with seven spiral well-defended gates. There are mud walls all around the fort. Inside the fort, the major
            buildings are the prayer hall, a tomb and a mosque.[2] There is an overhanging where executions took
            place.[5] There are many gates structures protecting this fort. Mana Daravaja is one of the many gates of
            the fort. Its also called the origin of Tune.

            At the centre of the fort is a water pond which is called 'Badami Talav', and to the south of this pond are
            statues of Jijabai and a young Shiva. In the fort there are two water springs, called Ganges and Yamuna,
            which have water throughout the year. Two kilometers away from this fort there are the Buddhist rock-cut
            caves, called Lenyadri caves, which is also one of Ashtavinayak temple in Maharashtra. It has been declared
            as a protected monument.
        </p>
        <p class="font1"> <br> Access  :- <br>
            The nearest town Junnar is a taluka place and is well connected by road. Junnar is about 90 km from Pune. The fort is at about 2â€“3 km from the junnar town. It is easy to reach the fort top via main entrance, however the trekkers with proper climbing equipment can try the chain route which is located on the western scarp of the fort. From the top of the fort, Narayangad, Hadsar, Chavand and Nimgiri forts can easily be seen.
