        <p class="font1">Daulatabad Fort, also known as Devagiri or Deogiri, is a historic fortified citadel located in
            Devagiri village near [AURANGABAD, Maharashtra]], India. It was the capital of the Yadava dynasty (9th
            century–14th century CE), for a brief time the capital of the Delhi Sultanate (1327–1334), and later a
            secondary capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate (1499–1636).

            Around the 6th century CE, Devagiri emerged as an important uplands town near present-day Sambhaji Nagar,
            along caravan routes going towards western and southern India.[6][7][8][9] The historical triangular
            fortress in the city was initially built around 1187 by the first Yadava king, Bhillama V.[10] In 1308, the
            city was annexed by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, which ruled over most of the Indian
            subcontinent. In 1327, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate renamed the city from Devagiri to
            Daulatabad and shifted his imperial capital to the city from Delhi, ordering a mass migration of Delhi's
            population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital of the
            Delhi Sultanate was shifted back to Delhi.

            In 1499, Daulatabad became a part of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, who used it as their secondary capital. In
            1610, near Daulatabad Fort, the new city of Aurangabad, then named Khadki, was established to serve as the
            capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate by the Ethiopian military leader Malik Ambar, who was brought to India
            as a slave but rose to become a popular Prime Minister of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate. Most of the present-day
            fortifications at Daulatabad Fort were constructed under the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.</p>

        <p class="font1"> <br> The Fort :- <br>

            The area of the city the hill-fortress of Devagiri (sometimes Latinised to Deogiri). It stands on a conical
            hill, about 200 meters high. Much of the lower slopes of the hill has been cut away by Yadava dynasty rulers
            to leave 50-meter vertical sides to improve defenses. The fort is a place of extraordinary strength. The
            only means of access to the summit is by a narrow bridge, with the passage for not more than two people
            abreast, and a long gallery, excavated in the rock, which has, for the most part, a very gradual upward
            slope.

            About midway along this gallery, the access gallery has steep stairs, the top of which is covered by a
            grating destined in time of war to form the hearth of a huge fire kept burning by the garrison above. At
            the summit, and at intervals on the slope, are specimens of massive old cannon facing out over the
            surrounding countryside. Also at the midway, there is a cave entrance meant to confuse the enemies.

            The fort had the following specialties which are listed along with their advantages :

            No separate exit from the fort, only one entrance/exit - This is designed to confuse the enemy soldiers to
            drive deep into the fort in search of an exit, at their own peril.
            No parallel gates - This is designed to break the momentum of the invading army. Also, the flag mast is on
            the left hill, which the enemy will try to capitulate, thus will always turn left. But the real gates of the
            fort are on the right & the false ones on the left, thus confusing the enemy.
            Spikes on the gates - In the era before gunpowder, intoxicated elephants were used as a battering ram to
            break open the gates. The presence of spikes ensured that the elephants died of injury.
            Complex arrangement of entryways, curved walls, false doors - Designed to confuse the enemy, false, but
            well-designed gates on the left side lured the enemy soldiers in & trapped them inside, eventually feeding
            them to crocodiles.
            The hill is shaped like a smooth tortoise back - this prevented the use of mountain lizards as climbers,
            because they cannot stick to it.</p>

        <p class="font1"> <br> History :- <br>
            The site had been occupied since at least 100 BCE, and now has remains of Hindu & Jain temples similar to
            those at Ajanta and Ellora. A series of niches carved with Jain Tirthankara in cave 32.

            The city is said to have been founded c. 1187 by Bhillama V, a Yadava prince who renounced his allegiance to
            the Chalukyas and established the power of the Yadava dynasty in the west.[20] During the rule of the Yadava
            king Ramachandra, Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate raided Devagiri in 1296, forcing the Yadavas to pay a
            hefty tribute. When the tribute payments stopped, Alauddin sent a second expedition to Devagiri in 1308,
            forcing Ramachandra to become his vassal.

            In 1328, Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi Sultanate transferred the capital of his kingdom to Devagiri, and
            renamed it Daulatabad. The sultan made Daulatabad (Devagiri) his second capital in 1327.[23] Some scholars
            argue that the idea behind transferring the capital was rational, because it lay more or less in the centre
            of the kingdom, and geographically secured the capital from the north-west frontier attacks.

            In the Daulatabad fort, he found the area arid & dry.His capital-shift strategy failed miserably. Hence he
            shifted back to Delhi & earned him the moniker "Mad King".

            The next important event in the Daulatabad fort time-line was the construction of the Chand Minar by the
            Bahmani ruler Hasan Gangu Bahmani, also known as Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah (r. 3 August 1347 – 11 February
            1358).

            Hasan Gangu built the Chand Minar as a replica of the Qutb Minar of Delhi, of which he was a great fan of.
            He employed Iranian architects to built the Minar who used Lapis Lazuli & Red Ocher for coloring. Currently,
            the Minar is out of bounds for the tourists, because of a suicide case.

            As we move further into the fort, we can see the Chini Mahal, a VIP prison built by Aurangzeb. In this
            prison, he kept Abul Hasan Tana Shah of the Qutb Shahi Dynasty of Hyderabad. The antecedents of Abul Hasan
            Tana Shah, the last Qutub Shahi king are shrouded in mystery. Although a kinsman of the Golconda royals, he
            spent his formative years as a disciple of renowned Sufi saint Shah Raju Qattal, leading a spartan existence
            away from the pomp and grandeur of royalty. Shah Raziuddin Hussaini, popularly known as Shah Raju, was held
            in high esteem by both the nobility and commoners of Hyderabad. Abdullah Qutub Shah, the seventh king of
            Golconda was among his most ardent devotees. He died in prison leaving no male heir to the throne.

            Most of the present-day fortification was constructed under the Bahmanis and the Nizam Shahs of
            Ahmadnagar.[1] The Mughal Governor of the Deccan under Shah Jahan, captured the fortress in 1632 and
            imprisoned the Nizam Shahi prince Husain Shah.

        <p class="font1"> <br>Monuments:- <br>
            The outer wall, 2.75 miles (4.43 km) in circumference, once enclosed the ancient city of Devagiri and
            between this and the base of the upper fort are three lines of defenses.

            Along with the fortifications, Daulatabad contains several notable monuments, of which the chief are the
            Chand Minar and the Chini Mahal.[25] The Chand Minar is a tower 210 ft (64 m). high and 70 ft (21 m). in
            circumference at the base, and was originally covered with beautiful Persian glazed tiles. It was erected in
            1445 by Ala-ud-din Bahmani to commemorate his capture of the fort. The Chini Mahal (literally: China
            Palace), is the ruin of a building once of great beauty. In it, Abul Hasan Tana Shah, the last of the Qutb
            Shahi kings of Golconda, was imprisoned by Aurangzeb in 1687.
